### Public Documentation

There is not specific public documentation about this blueprint but the following documentation could be consulted for architecture understanding:

[Deploy highly available network virtual appliances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/nva-ha)

### Version

|Version|Target SCF|
|:--|:--|
|1.2|SM|

### Dependencies

The following resources and requirements must exist before the deployment can take place:


- Azure Subscription
- Log Analytics Workspace (formerly OMS) for health logs and metrics
- A Key Vault that stores the sicKey and CloudGuard password (it is the same password for both secrets). 
- A deployment Service Principal with owner permissions on the resource group and with access in the Key Vault to get the secrets.
  * Please, request to Protect's team the creation and store of the secret in other HUBs.
- A CloudGuard management controller (management server)
  * The management server used in Europe and Brasil is cybp1weunvav001. Please, confirm this value with Protect's team for each deployment. 
- An Azure application to manage the subscription from the management server. It is necessary an Azure application for each HUB/subscription 
  * Please, confirm the name of this application with Protect and assign it contributor permissions in the subscription.
Typically are named SP_CloudGuardControllerxxx
- A template in the CloudGuard management controller
  * The template is a configuration file that is provided to the NVAs from the management server. 
Typically, those templates are named:
    1. NIC template is named <entity>fwinet30
    2. SPC template is named <entity>fwpro30
    3. SNCtemplate is named <entity>fwnopro30
  * Please, confirm with Protect's team the existence and name of those configuration files. The name is build automatically so must fit with the previous naming convention.
- The backend LBs addressing is calculated with the cidrhost terraform function providing the 6th hostnumber in the backend range.
  * Examples: 1. Backend Subnet 107.104.26.224/27 â†’ Backend LB IP 107.104.26.230
